  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>Iconic Disc is an accessory designed to give your Mac an identity. It is a thin, magnetic frame that fits seamlessly over the glowing backlight of the Apple logo and holds an image printed on photo paper or a transparent film to illuminate it in a captivating glow. The company approached Cubicflow with the ultimate objective of funding their project through Kickstarter, and to develop their brand identity, web presence, and various collateral needed for the product campaign.</p>
