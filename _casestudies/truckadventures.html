  <h1>The Challenge</h1>

  <p>Truck Adventures wanted to up their game big for their 2nd annual event. They knew that growing exposure, building a brand, and really solidifying their web presence would all be key to increasing ticket sales. Our combined efforts led to an increase in over 400% in ticket sales with soaring conversion rates.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>Truck Adventures didn't really have a brand their first year, so for their 2nd annual event we really wanted to make sure they made the right impression. We created a corporate identity and logomark to launch alongside their completely new website complete with an e-commerce and ticketing system. We then used targeted social media campaigns to funnel people to the website.</p>
