  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>The Food Concierge is an online enthusiast community that bridges the disconnect between the food we eat and where it comes from. TFC approached us at their infancy, desiring the branding and design language that would tell their story. We love these multifaceted projects, and worked with The Food Concierge to help focus and refine their narrative while translating it into a complete visual identity and web presence with a slick user experience to-boot.</p>
