  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>House Advantage prides itself on being “the biggest gaming company that you have never heard of.” Their customer loyalty solutions power some of the largest casinos around the world -- if you’ve ever been to Vegas you’ve interacted with them and not even realized it. So we were thrilled when they came to us to design their new flagship mobile application - HALo Mobile - and overhaul the user experience. House Advantage continues to provide us with projects that clearly illustrate the benefits of Cubicflow’s creative and collaborative process.</p>
