### The Cubicflow Process

<br>

<br>

Our development process begins with an in-depth discovery process to identify problems and objectives. From there, we move to iterate through something called “10x,” before transitioning into full development mode.

<br><br>

<br>

The first stage of our process begins with a thorough discovery period to identify objectives and challenges, to immerse ourselves in the brand and end user. By the end of this stage we will have a sharp focus and clearly defined spec.  

<br><br>

<br>

We then begin the '10x' process with the aim to explore as many related ideas as possible, test assumptions -- sometimes even rethink a concept entirely -- and focus those ideas into a Minimal Value Product (MVP).

<br><br>

<br>

Once we have the MVP...we develop, develop, develop! Quality control is an important and ongoing part of the process before we finally move to deploy.
